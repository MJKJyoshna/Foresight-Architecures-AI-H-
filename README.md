# Foresight-Architecures-AI-Hackathon
Our project aims to create an AI-driven solution for smart cities that enhances urban living through predictive maintenance and personalized services. By analyzing data from city infrastructure and IoT devices, we can predict and prevent issues before they arise, ensuring efficient management and reduced downtime. Additionally, our AI models personalize services for residents, improving their daily experiences. An open innovation platform allows for continuous improvement and collaboration, making the city smarter, safer, and more responsive to its citizens' needs.
